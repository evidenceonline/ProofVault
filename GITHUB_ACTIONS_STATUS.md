# GitHub Actions Status

## Current Issue: TOKEN Secret Not Accessible

The test confirmed that:
- ❌ Custom `TOKEN` secret is NOT accessible 
- ✅ Default `GITHUB_TOKEN` IS accessible

## Solution Implemented

The workflow now falls back to using the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` when the custom TOKEN is not available. This should allow the build to proceed.

## If Build Still Fails

If the build fails with the default GITHUB_TOKEN, it might be due to:

1. **Insufficient permissions** - The default token might not have access to private repositories that Tessellation framework needs
2. **Rate limiting** - The default token has stricter rate limits

## To Add Custom TOKEN (Recommended)

1. Go to: https://github.com/evidenceonline/ProofVault/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Name: `TOKEN` (exactly this)
4. Value: Your GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` scope

### Creating a Personal Access Token

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name like "ProofVault Build"
4. Select scopes:
   - ✅ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - ✅ `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflows)
5. Generate and copy the token
6. Add it as the TOKEN secret in your repository

## Current Workflow Status

The main workflow should now:
1. Attempt to use custom TOKEN
2. Fall back to default GITHUB_TOKEN
3. Continue with the build process
