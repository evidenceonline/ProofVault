## Legal References & Court Acceptance

### Blockchain Evidence in Court (Precedent)

**Key Cases:**

1. **United States v. Singh (2018)**
   - District Court of Vermont accepted blockchain timestamp evidence
   - Court recognized blockchain as reliable timestamping mechanism

2. **Ruffer Systems v. Regnology (2019)**
   - UK High Court admitted blockchain evidence of contract terms
   - Judge noted "blockchain provides certainty of timestamp"

3. **Qihoo v. Tencent (2019)**
   - Chinese court accepted blockchain-verified screenshots as evidence
   - Established precedent for cryptographic verification in IP cases

4. **State of Vermont (Blockchain Legislation - 2016)**
   - First US state to recognize blockchain records as legal evidence
   - Vermont Rule of Evidence 902(13): blockchain self-authentication

**Federal Rules of Evidence:**
- **Rule 901:** Authentication requirement (blockchain signatures satisfy)
- **Rule 902(13/14):** Self-authenticating records (blockchain qualifies)
- **Rule 1001-1008:** Best Evidence Rule (hash verification satisfies)

---

## Glossary for Non-Technical Executives

**Blockchain:** A decentralized ledger (record book) that cannot be altered once written. Think: notary public + permanent filing + thousands of witnesses.

**Hash (SHA-256):** A unique fingerprint for digital content. Change one letter → completely different fingerprint. Used to prove content hasn't been tampered with.

**Digital Evidence API:** Constellation Network's service that stamps evidence onto the blockchain (like a digital notary).

**Chain of Custody:** Legal requirement to document who handled evidence and when. Our system automatically creates this audit trail.

**Immutable:** Cannot be changed or deleted. Once on blockchain, evidence record exists forever.

**Cryptographic Proof:** Mathematical certainty (not just human trust) that evidence is authentic.

**Tamper-Evident:** Any modification to evidence is immediately detectable through hash comparison.

**SaaS (Software as a Service):** Cloud software sold by subscription (like Netflix for business software).

**ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue):** Total yearly subscription revenue (key SaaS metric).

**CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost):** Cost to acquire one customer (marketing + sales expenses).

**LTV (Lifetime Value):** Total revenue from a customer over their entire relationship with us.

**Churn Rate:** Percentage of customers who cancel subscriptions (lower is better).

**Product-Led Growth:** Customers discover and adopt product themselves (vs. sales-driven).
